Due to the rise of Edge Computing \cite{7488250}, small portable devices have to process efficiently different algorithms, cryptography, 
and in some cases, proprietary protocols.

Finite field $GF(2^m)$ arithmetic has been identified to be used in many applications, such as pre-quantic cryptography, 
post-quantum cryptography, and error correction codes. Therefore, an extension of the instructions is proposed in this work.

From the previous section, it can be seen that for AES and Reed-Solomon, a reduction of 80\% was achieved 
in the number of instructions at the expense of a 5.71\% increment in logic utilization.

This extension is oriented to applications where it is necessary to process different protocols that use $GF(2^m)$ arithmetic. 
Furthermore, at the same time, it does not exist a dedicated coprocessor in the system due to area and consumption restrictions.
