Due to the rise of Edge Computing \cite{7488250}, small portable devices have to process 
efficiently different error correction codes, cryptography, 
and in some cases, proprietary protocols.

Finite field $GF(2^m)$ arithmetic has been identified to be used in many applications, such as pre-quantum cryptography, and error correction codes. Therefore, an extension of the instructions is proposed in this work. 
It is oriented to applications where it is necessary to process different protocols that use finite field arithmetic.

From the previous section, it can be seen that for AES and Reed-Solomon, a reduction of 77.75\% was achieved 
in the number of clock cycles at the expense of a 6.94\% increment in logic utilization.

As future work, we are using these instructions for post-quantum cryptography. The Classic McEliece and HQC algorithms are adapted to the RISC-V architecture. We are in the stage of evaluating its performance and extracting preliminary results.
