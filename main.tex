%% The abstract is a short summary of the work to be presented in the
%% article.
\begin{abstract}
  With the rise of Edge Computing and the advancement of cryptography and error correction codes, 
  portable device processors must handle a wide range of algorithms based on Galois field arithmetic. A tradeoff between speed and power consumption is required 
  to optimize the execution time of a general-purpose processor without reducing efficiency, if these operations are included in the 
  processor's instruction set. In this work, a RISC-V instruction set for multiplication of Galois field arithmetic is implemented and validated using SweRV-EL2 1.3 on a Nexys A7 FPGA. 
  Performance in some algorithms like AES and Reed-Solomon codes has been improved 
  at the expense of a slight increase in logic utilization.
