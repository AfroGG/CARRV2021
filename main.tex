\begin{abstract}
  With the advancement of cryptography and error correction codes, portable device processors 
  must handle a wide range of algorithms. A tradeoff between speed and area should be found to 
  accelerate the execution time of the CPU. As $GF(2^m)$ arithmetic is the basis of many algorithms, 
  an RISC-V instruction set extension is proposed in this work. The hardware is implemented, and the 
  results are validated using SweRVolf SoC (SweRV EL2 1.3) on a Nexys A7 FPGA. A 5X acceleration 
  is achieved for AES and Reed-Solomon codes at the expense of increasing the logic utilization by 7.5\%.
